One of the inherent truths of trial and error is that there's virtually a 100% chance of errors. Some will be more significant than others. These may leave this blog temporarily inaccessible, (note that the length of downtime will have a direct effect on the frequency and intensity of the profanity I will use as I try to fix the problem ü§¨.)

You may run across some of the following, (from [Kinsta's Blog](https://kinsta.com/blog/http-status-codes/ "Kinsta's Blog"))...

* **404:** ‚ÄúThe requested resource was not found.‚Äù This is the most common error message of them all. This code means that the [requested resource does not exist](https://kinsta.com/blog/error-404-not-found/), and the server does not know if it ever existed.
* **500:** ‚ÄúThere was an error on the server and the request could not be completed.‚Äù This is generic code that simply means ‚Äúinternal server error‚Äù. Something went wrong on the server and the requested resource was not delivered. This code is typically generated by third-party plugins, faulty PHP, or even the connection to the database breaking. 
* **502:** ‚ÄúBad Gateway.‚Äù This error code typically means that one server has received an invalid response from another, such as when a proxy server is in use. Other times a query or request will take too long, and so it is canceled or killed by the server and the connection to the database breaks.
* **503:** ‚ÄúThe server is unavailable to handle this request right now.‚Äù The request cannot be completed at this point in time. This code may be returned by an overloaded server that is unable to handle additional requests.

Rest assured any and/or all of the above are almost 110% MY fault.
